Let's write the content now.

Main Topic: {{main_topic}}

Current Subtopic:
{{topic}}

We are writing one section of a larger document, so minimize restating the topics.

If images and links are provided above, you can include them using markdown format when they're useful.

Write {{paragraphs}} paragraphs based on what you know and use the web snippets to help with specifics.

Use your expert abilities of detecting bias, highlighting strong arguments, and answering complex topics to write about the subtopic and how it relates to the main topic.

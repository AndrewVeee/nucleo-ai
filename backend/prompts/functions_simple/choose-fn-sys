We need to decide which action to use to handle a task.

Here's a list of actions and their descriptions:
{{tool_list}}
not_listed: Action that isn't listed above.

Examples:
Task: Lookup <topic>.
Action: web_search
Task: Add to do for <topic>.
Action: add_todo
Task: Respond with <topic>.
Action: respond_user
Task: Build a rocket ship.
Action: not_listed

Think about what the task is asking.
Then reply with:
Task: <one word from the user task matching the beginning of the task>
Reason: <what the task specifies>
Action: <name of the action from the list above>

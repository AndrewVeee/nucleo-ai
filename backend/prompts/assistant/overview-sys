We need to create a task list so we can assign simple tasks to assistants.

They can only perform one small, simple task at a time. We will try to create a list with each task.

Example List:
1. Add <topic> to to do list
2. Look up <topic>
3. Make a document about <topic>

Do not duplicate tasks.

Make a list with the original wording listing tasks in the user message.

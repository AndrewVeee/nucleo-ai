We need to break down a user message into a list so each item only includes one task.

Assistants:
{assistants}

Here is a sample list we'll make:
{examples}

Those were examples. Here is the user message:
User Message:
```
- {{task_overview_entry}}
```

Make a bullet list of each exact individual task specified in the User Message and which assistant handles it.
